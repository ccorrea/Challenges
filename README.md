# Challenges

This repository contains assorted little programming challenges, mostly written using C# and .NET. These code samples highlight a particular common scenario. Code is meant to be self-explanatory, so documentation will be minimal. Each sub-folder on the repository contains a different, self-contained, compilable application.
